# Flutter App with Dio and JSON Serialization

This Flutter application demonstrates how to use the Dio package for making HTTP requests and JSON serialization with json_serializable.

## Features

- Makes HTTP requests to a RESTful API using Dio.
- Parses JSON data received from the API into Dart objects using json_serializable.
- Displays the fetched data in the UI.

## What is Dio?

[Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) is a powerful HTTP client for Dart, inspired by the Retrofit library in Android. It provides a simple and expressive API for making HTTP requests and interacting with RESTful APIs. Dio supports various HTTP methods, request/response interception, file uploading, and more.

## What is JSON Serialization?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a client. JSON Serialization refers to the process of converting JSON data into Dart objects and vice versa. 

[json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) is a Dart package that simplifies JSON serialization and deserialization by automatically generating serialization code based on annotated Dart classes. By annotating your Dart classes with `@JsonSerializable()`, you can generate serialization code using the `json_serializable` package's build runner.

## Getting Started

To run this Flutter app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

   cd your-repository
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
Dependencies
This project uses the following dependencies:

dio: A powerful HTTP client for Dart.
json_annotation: Provides utilities for converting between Dart objects and JSON.
json_serializable: Automatically generate code for JSON serialization and deserialization.
Usage
To integrate Dio and JSON serialization into your own Flutter project, follow these steps:

Add the dio, json_annotation, and json_serializable dependencies to your pubspec.yaml file:

yaml
Copy code
dependencies:
  dio: ^4.0.0
dev_dependencies:
  json_annotation: ^4.1.0
  json_serializable: ^4.1.0
Run flutter pub get to install the dependencies.

Create Dart classes to represent your JSON data structures. Annotate these classes with @JsonSerializable() and run the build runner to generate serialization code:

bash
Copy code
flutter pub run build_runner build
Use the Dio package to make HTTP requests to your API endpoints. Deserialize the JSON response using the generated Dart classes.
